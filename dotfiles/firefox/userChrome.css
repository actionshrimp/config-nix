/*
To hide the native tabs, you'll have to add a new file called userChrome.css and the css property visibility: collapse.

To do this, in Firefox, navigate to about:support. Under the Application Basics section, there will be a section called Profile Directory with a button to Open Directory.

In the Profile Directory create a new folder called chrome. In the chrome folder create or edit the file userChrome.css if it already exists.

Finally, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true, and restart firefox.
